## Description:
This is a command line README generator created using NodeJS. Run the "node index.js" command, the app will prompt you for the details to include for each section in a high-quality README.md file. ([Example of Professional README](https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/github/professional-readme-guide))

I created this as a practice project for creating command line apps and NodeJS. 

This app also prompts you for the file name of a screenshot for your project to include in the Usage section. Your screen shot must be in a assets/images directory, if it is not feel free to adjust the markdown file after it is created. 

Thank you for checking out my project, Enjoy!
